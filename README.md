### Saturdays.ai - Guadalajara - 4th Edition 

![Guadalajara](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31071493/202862541-e2e015a9-0693-4e50-982e-78794888265f.png)

The main objective of the business is to promote more places to park on the streets of the municipality of Guadalajara, as well as to avoid the lifting of infractions, since in 2021, more than 156 thousand infractions of 11 different types were registered:
* Type 1: Bypass the parking meter fee.
* Type 2: Invading two or more parking spaces.
* Type 3: Obstruct a garage.
* Type 4: Parking at an intersection or on a yellow line.
* Type 5: Parking in exclusive places, firefighters, police, medical services or people with disabilities.
* Type 6: Cord or battery.
* Type 7: Immobilized vehicle.
* Type 8: For insulting or verbally assaulting a road officer.
* Type 9: Due to vehicle abandonment.
* Type 10: Exceeding time in the loading and unloading spaces.
* Type 11: Physically assaulting a traffic officer.


There are two very strong potential markets within this project, the first is drivers looking for a place to park, since they often resort to not paying a parking meter fee, or to use spaces that are not designated for vehicle parking, such as they are yellow lines, ramps or places for the disabled, spaces for firefighters, police or medical services, thus falling into these violations described above, so being able to obtain these places where other drivers have normally been previously cited will help future drivers to avoid these violations. On the other hand, the other potential market will be the Ministry of Mobility, which will be able to obtain a result of which are the zones, dates and times with the most infractions and be able to propose solutions to said road problem.

As a functional prototype deployment, it was decided to make a Dashboard so that the two main markets, motorists and road agents, can consult the historical information from 2021 to August 2022 of the infractions. In this dashboard you can first find general information about the team that developed it, where you can also see the Saturdays AI logo as a header, followed by a short description of the problem that this project sought to solve. Next, the three types of infractions that were used as targets for this model are seen, and the explanation of each of the infractions that are applied in the ZMG, which can be filtered in the following 4 main Dashboard graphs: Top 50 Violated Vehicle Makes, Top 10 Violated Vehicle License Plate Status, Number of Violations by Day of Week, and Number of Violations by Hour of Day. And finally, there is an interactive map where each of the more than 305,000 infractions that have been registered through the city's system is geographically registered. As mentioned before, this dashboard can be of great help to motorists to locate the areas where skip fare infractions are regularly applied, thus seeking to improve driver education and implement good practices to avoid not paying a parking meter, or also locate the areas where they are normally infracted for parking in places where it is not allowed and thus avoid doing so. On the other hand, road agents and the corresponding secretariat can locate these areas where there is a lack of parking for motorists and thus be able to reach joint solutions and achieve a better road culture. This dashboard is available at the following link: https://infraccionesgdl.herokuapp.com/
